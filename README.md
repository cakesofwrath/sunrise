# sunrise
A little project I'm doing instead of Chemistry. Shows time of sunrise at your location, where it's night and day, and instagram photos with tag #sunrise around the world.

Credit for the solar plotting goes to people much smarter than me, 
especially [Antonio Esquer, Preston Hunt, and Ed Williams](http://blog.char95.com/demos/daylight-on-google-maps/) .

The background creds go to [Marty Saetre](http://codepen.io/msaetre/pen/nlsJL).
